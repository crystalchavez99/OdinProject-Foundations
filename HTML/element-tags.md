# Elements and Tags

## Intro
HTML(Hypertext markup langauge) defines structure and content of webpages.

## Elements/Tags
Elements on an HTML page are pieces of content wrapped in opening and closing tags.

Opening tags tell the browser this is the start of an HTML element, which are comprised of a keyword enclosed in angle brackets.

Closing tags tell the browser where the element ends, just need to add a forward slash before the keyword.
```HTML
<p> <!-- Opening tag --> </p> <!-- Closing Tag-->
```
Think of them as containers for content as the tags tell  browser what element contain and how to format.

There are some HTML elements that do not have a closing tag. These are known as empty elements because they donâ€™t wrap any content.
