# CSS BOX MODEL
The most important skills you need to master with CSS are positioning and layout.


## Box Model
The first important concept that you need to understand to be successful in CSS is the box model.

Basically, every single thing on a webpage is a rectangular box. These boxes can have other boxes in them and can sit alongside one another.

The only real complication here is that there are multiple ways to manipulate the size of these boxes, and the space between them, using `margin`, `padding`, and `border`

The assigned articles go into more depth on this concept, but to sum it up briefly: padding increases the space between the edge of a box and the content inside of it; margin increases the space between a box and any others that sit next to it; and border adds space (even if itâ€™s only a pixel or two) between the margin and the padding.
